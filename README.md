## Contents

- IOS_slider: A continuous (100-point) version of the Inclusion of Other in Self (IOS) scale (Aron, Aron, & Smollan, 1992)
- scalar_slider_template: A simple 100-point slider based off jquery UI for web experiments. (It's a generalization of IOS_slider)


- continuous_time_slider: A simple experiment with a slider, that records the value of the slider every X seconds, and saves the vector as a variable. (I also have a version that allows this to be integrated into Qualtrics).
